### Developement ideas

#### Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Software not only must be valuable and delivered often, it must be working or done. Scrum requires the features to meet a team-defined Definition of Done. Ideally, this should mean that the feature is potentially shippable. - See more at: https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2013/november/the-agile-manifesto-principles-what-do-they-mean#sthash.VIyoZqyU.dpuf

#### The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

On-line meetings and instant messaging tools are available that improve communication when teams are separated.
