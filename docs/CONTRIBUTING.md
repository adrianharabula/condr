## Submitting a pull request

0. Fork and clone the repository (if you're a developer with push access you can skip this)
0. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my_work`
0. Make your change, run the code, make sure everything is fine (please don't push to master non working code!)
0. Push the branch to remote and submit a pull request OR Push to your fork and submit a pull request
0. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.
0. We use [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io) to review code
0. If anything is wrong we comment code in reviewable and wait for someone to fix it
0. To fix make another commit/s and push them to the __my_work__ remote branch
0. Again someone else will review the code with [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io)
0. If everything is ok, your code will be merged into master

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
