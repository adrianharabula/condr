## The app

**Tell us your wishes and we'll help you decide!** ConDr gives you suggestions whether to buy or not a product you are looking for by searching through our database.

See online app [here](https://condr.me).

Original request here:
 > Develop a web tool to provide consumers with advice on decisions to purchase goods / services in an ethical way. The system will be able to store and use the simple rules of the form "if <condition> then <action>" - in our case, for example, "we will not buy / use the product P because it contains / uses substance S", or "I will choose P instead of Q because of M (for example, low mobility or unreasonable price)"- to provide suggestions on personal or group resources. The application will also provide statistics on most of the desired resources, restrictions, people with similar preferences, etc. As a source of inspiration, see Buycott. Bonus: using web microservices.
